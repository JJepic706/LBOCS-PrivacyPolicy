### Data Collection:
- No personal data is collected or stored by the app.

- The following is the only data that leaves the app when using the rate function:

- When rating a conversation starter or pickup line, your rating will be attached to a random number between 1-100. It will then be sent to my Firebase server, and your rating will be stored next to the random number. The random number does not correlate with you or your device. It is to make sure that my server is not overloaded by too many ratings. If someone else rates the same item as you and their device generates the same random number as yours, the value you submitted will be replaced by theirs. This is to make sure that my server doesn't go over the allocated storage available.


### Permissions:
 - The following permissions are utilized by the app. If you do not grant them, the app may not function properly and may crash unexpectedly.

- "android.permission.VIBRATE" = Having this permission enabled will allow my app to make your device vibrate. It is only utilized when the "Haptic feedback" option is turned on in the app settings. This causes the device to vibrate when you interact with my app. This permission is automatically given by the device and may not be able to be revoked by the user. 

- "android.permission.INTERNET" = Having this permission enabled will allow my app to access the internet or mobile data your device is connected to. This permission is only used when viewing or using the "Ratings" function in the app (when you see how many stars an item has) to get the value from my Firebase server. This permission is automatically given by the device and should be able to be blocked by the user.

- The app DOES NOT read any data from your device other than the app data. The app data includes the app itself and any shared preference files created by the app/user.


### Definitions:
- Firebase Server: Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android, and Web apps. Firebase provides lots of tools, including the ability to store data for programs to use and update that data in real-time as the user/developer changes it.

- Shared Preferences: A function used in Android app development that allows the app to store values for use later or even after app closure. In my app, it's used to store your app settings and preferences. This includes data like whether you have dark mode enabled or notifications on. This data can only be accessed by the app and is only stored on your device. To clear it, clear the app data or app cache. This will completely reset the app.
